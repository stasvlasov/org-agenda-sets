=org-agenda-sets.el= provides macro to define sets of (org) files that can be used for =org-agenda-files= and  interactive function(s) that you can use to switch between sets and repopulate =org-agenda-files=. When files in sets are (asynchronously) scanned on your disk it saves it so you do not need to re-scan on next emacs session. It also provides basic sets operations (e.g., sets union, subtract, overlap).
